"""Deterministic ROI & effort-estimation math for the AP discovery agent.

This module replaces the old "let the LLM free-guess the numbers" approach.
The LLM is still used for what it is good at -- reading the transcript into
structured facts and classifying WHICH technical components an automation needs
-- but every financial figure produced here is computed deterministically in
Python from those grounded inputs, so identical inputs always yield identical
ROI. This is what makes the projections reproducible and defensible.
